task [cvs]

Hey Vera, 
I have made a CSV file for you. 
A CSV file is a structured way
 to share data that is also readable as plain text. 
 It is like Excel, but you don't need Excel 
 (although Excel is also able to work with CSV files).
 In this CSV file I'll attach there are three columns 
 (each separated by a comma ","). 
 They are state, price, and sqft (square feet).
 There are 10,000 rows and each one of these represents a record. 
 I'd like you to write a Python program to open this file 
 and count
 how many properties in California have 
 a price per square foot of $40 / square foot (or more).
 All of this data is random, but it will be good for this exercise.
